|SDK|
#####

The |SDK| is a complete software stack allowing users to seamlessly leverage the hardware accelerated features of Xilinx video codec units and enable high-density real-time transcoding for live streaming video service providers, OEMs, and Content Delivery Network (CDNs). Included in the |SDK| are pre-compiled versions of FFmpeg and GStreamer which integrate video transcoding plug-ins for Xilinx devices, enabling simple hardware acceleration of video decoding, scaling and encoding using these popular tools. The |SDK| also provides a C-based application programming interface (API) which facilitates the integration of Xilinx video codec units transcoding capabilities in proprietary frameworks. The |SDK| can be leveraged on-premises with Alveo U30 cards and in the cloud with |VT1| instances. 

For a rapid overview of the |SDK| v3.0, see `this blog post <https://community.amd.com/t5/adaptive-computing/amd-xilinx-video-sdk-3-0-now-available-to-further-ease-the/ba-p/593533>`_.
