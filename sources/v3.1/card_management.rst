Overview
********

The |SDK| builds on the Xilinx Runtime (XRT) and the Xilinx Resource Manager (XRM) to interface with Xilinx video acceleration cards. The |SDK| includes the ``xbutil``, ``xbmgmt`` and ``xrmadm`` command line tools for card installation, upgrade, and management.


xbutil and xbmgmt
=================

The Xilinx® Board Utility (``xbutil``) and the Xilinx® Board Management Utility (``xbmgmt``) are standalone command line tools used to query and administer Xilinx acceleration cards such as the Alveo U30. 

- ``xbutil`` is used to examine, identify, program, and validate the installed accelerator card(s). 
- ``xbmgmt`` is used to flash the card firmware, examine devices, and administer the installed accelerator card(s). Running this command requires sudo privileges.

.. note::
   The ``xbmgmt`` tool is not supported on |VT1| instances.

The ``xbutil`` and ``xbmgmt`` commands typically target one device at a time using a PCIe BDF (Bus:Device.Function) identifier. Each device has two BDFs: a User BDF and a Management BDF. The BDF notation works as follows:

- PCI Domain number, often padded using leading zeros to four digits
- A colon (:)
- PCI Bus number in hexadecimal, often padded using a leading zeros to two or four digits
- A colon (:)
- PCI Device number in hexadecimal, often padded using a leading zero to two digits . Sometimes this is also referred to as the slot number.
- A decimal point (.)
- PCI Function number in hexadecimal. Only this last digit will differ between the User BDF and the Management BDF.

The ``xbutil`` command expects the User BDF of the targeted device while the ``xbmgmt`` command expects the Management BDF of the targeted device.

.. The ``xbutil`` and ``xbmgmt`` commands are delivered as part of the Xilinx Runtime (XRT) package. The complete documentation for these commands can be found in the main XRT documentation:

.. - https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/xbutil.html
.. - https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/xbmgmt.html


xrmadm and xrmd
===============

The Xilinx® FPGA resource manager (XRM) is the software which manages the hardware accelerators available in the system. The XRM daemon (``xrmd``) is a background process supporting reservation, allocation, and release of hardware acceleration resources. The XRM ``xrmadm`` command line tool is used to interact with the XRM daemon (``xrmd``) in order to check status and generate resource utilization reports. 

For more details about the XRM commands specific to the |SDK| refer to the :ref:`XRM Command Reference Guide <xrm-reference>`.

.. _device-bdf:

Device User BDF
===============

The list of all installed Xilinx devices, including their User BDF is obtained with the ``xbutil examine`` command.

For example, the command below detected 4 devices and lists the Management BDF for each of them::

    $ xbutil examine

    ...

    Devices present
      [0000:e3:00.1] : xilinx_u30_gen3x4_base_2
      [0000:e2:00.1] : xilinx_u30_gen3x4_base_2
      [0000:22:00.1] : xilinx_u30_gen3x4_base_2
      [0000:21:00.1] : xilinx_u30_gen3x4_base_2

The last device listed has a User BDF of 0000:21:00.1, which describes Domain 0, Bus 21, Device 00, Function 1. 


.. _device-management-bdf:

Device Management BDF
=====================

The list of all installed Xilinx devices, including their Management BDF is obtained with the ``xbmgmt examine`` command.

NOTE: The colons of the BDF identifier must be separated by a backslash.

.. rubric:: Example

- Assuming a device with Management BDF 0000:e3:00.0::

    $ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:e3\:00.0/instance
    58112

- The xclmgmtID of this device is 58112

|

.. _card-serial_number:

Card Serial Number
==================

You can look-up the serial number of a card by using the User BDF of a device located on the card and running the following command::

    cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<Domain>\:<Bus>\:<Device>.<Function>/xmc.u.<xxx>/serial_num

NOTE: The colons of the BDF identifier must be separated by a backslash and <xxx> is an integer number unique to each device. 


.. rubric:: Example

- Assuming a device with BDF 0000:e3:00.1::

    $ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:e3\:00.1/xmc.u.19922947/serial_num 
    XFL1RT5PHT31

- The serial number of the card on which this device is located XFL1RT5PHT31

**********************
Checking Device Status
**********************

The ``xbutil examine -d <User BDF> --report <type>`` commands provides additional details about the status of each Xilinx device installed. 

The --report (or -r) switch is used to view specific report(s) of interest from the following options:

- ``electrical``: Reports Electrical and power sensors present on the device
- ``firewall``: Reports the current firewall status
- ``host``: Reports the host configuration and drivers
- ``mailbox``: Mailbox metrics of the device
- ``memory``: Reports memory topology of the XCLBIN (if XCLBIN is already loaded)
- ``pcie-info``: PCIe information of the device
- ``platform``: Platforms flashed on the device
- ``thermal``: Reports thermal sensors present on the device

These reports can also be generated in a JSON file by adding ``--format JSON -o <filename>`` to the ``xbutil examine`` command.

Example of thermal and electrical reports for the device with User BDF 0000:e3:00.1::

    $ xbutil examine -d e3:00.1 --report thermal electrical

.. _mapping-devices-to-cards:

************************
Mapping Devices to Cards
************************

Knowing which devices are on which card is useful to selectively reset or recover a card. This is done by mapping the BDFs of the devices to the serial number of the cards as explained in the instructions below:

#. List the User BDFs of each of the devices on all the Alveo U30 cards installed in your system::

    xbutil examine

#. For each User BDF, look-up the corresponding serial number::

    cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<Domain>\:<Bus>\:<Device>.<Function>/xmc.u.<xxx>/serial_num

   The colons of the BDF identifier must be separated by a backslash and <xxx> is an integer number unique to each device. For example, for the device with BDF 0000:e3:00.1::

    $ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:e3\:00.1/xmc.u.19922947/serial_num 
    XFL1RT5PHT31

#. Note the serial number associated with each BDF. Two devices with the same serial number are on the same card. 

|

.. _xbutil-validate:

************************
Running Device Self-Test
************************

.. note::
   This action is only available on-premises and is not supported on |VT1| instances.

The ``xbutil validate`` command can be used to check and validate the health of the devices on your Alveo U30 cards by executing a special built-in test. In order to run this command, the XRM daemon must first be stopped, otherwise the test will error with ``xclbin on card is in use`` and ``failed to load xclbin`` messages.

#. List the User BDFs of each of the devices on all the Alveo U30 cards installed in your system::

    xbutil examine

#. Stop the XRM daemon::

    sudo /opt/xilinx/xrm/tools/stop_xrmd.sh

#. For each of the devices, run the self-checking test::
    
    xbutil validate --device <User BDF>

#. After all tests have been run, restart the XRM daemon and reload the environment::

    sudo /opt/xilinx/xrm/tools/start_xrmd.sh
    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

|

.. _card-reset:

****************
Resetting a Card
****************

.. note::
   This action is only available on-premises and is not supported on |VT1| instances.

Resetting an Alveo U30 card is done with the ``xbutil reset --device <BDF>`` command, where BDF identifies one of the two devices on the card to be reset. If you need to identify which two devices are on a given card in order reset only these two devices, refer to the :ref:`device-to-card mapping <mapping-devices-to-cards>` instructions.


.. rubric:: IMPORTANT 

- The command will reset the device specified with the User BDF **as well as all other devices present on the same Xilinx card**. It is not possible to reset only one device. 

- Since ``xbutil reset`` resets all devices of a given card, Xilinx recommends against assigning a single device to a containerized application.

- ``xbutil reset`` will not work within containers or virtual machines when the management functions are not opened to the user.



#. Verify that all jobs running on both devices of the card can be safely interrupted.

#. List the User BDFs of each of the devices on all the Alveo U30 cards installed in your system::

    xbutil examine

#. Reset one of the two devices on the card which needs to be reset. This command will reset **both** devices on that card, not just the specified device::

    xbutil reset --device <BDF>  

#. The resetted cards and devices will not be readily usable. The hardware binaries must be reloaded on the devices before running new jobs::

    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

|

.. _card-recovery:

*****************
Recovering a Card
*****************

.. note::
   This action is only available on-premises and is not supported on |VT1| instances.

In the event that your card has become corrupted and that a reset is not sufficient, you will need to recover it. This is normally be done in-band via a set of simple commands. Should the card's flash devices become corrupted to the point where it is no longer detected by PCIe, out-of-band recovery with a JTAG cable may be required.

.. _standard-recovery-flow:

Standard Recovery Flow
======================

.. note::
   The instructions below assume that you are trying to recover a system which was flashed with release 0.96.0 or newer. If this is not the case, `contact Xilinx <https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk/issues>`_.

#. Set up your environment:: 

    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh

#. List the Management BDF of your devices::

    sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt examine

   NOTE: There are two devices per Alveo U30 card. If you want to identify which two devices are on a given card in order recover only these two devices, refer to the :ref:`device-to-card mapping <mapping-devices-to-cards>` instructions.

#. For each device which needs to be recovered, run the following command to flash it with the golden image::

    sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt program --revert-to-golden --device <BDF>

   NOTE: You may receive an error indicating ``Factory reset not supported. No Golden image found on flash.``. This indicates the golden image must first be reflashed by following these instructions: `reflashing the golden image <https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk/issues/16#issuecomment-996230146>`_.
   
#. Cold boot the machine when all desired devices have been reverted to factory settings.


.. _advanced-recovery-flow:

Advanced Recovery Flow
======================

Should there be an issue with the standard in-band recovery process, it is still possible to recover the card using out-of-band methods. Please `contact Xilinx <https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk/issues>`_ for more details.
