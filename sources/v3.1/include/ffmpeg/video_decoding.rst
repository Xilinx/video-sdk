Video Decoding
*********************************************************

For the complete list of features and capabilities of the Xilinx hardware decoder, refer to the :ref:`Video Codec Unit <video-codec-unit>` section of the :doc:`Specs and Features </specs_and_features>` chapter of the documentation.

The Xilinx video decoder is leveraged in FFmpeg by setting the :option:`-c:v` option to ``mpsoc_vcu_hevc`` for HEVC or to ``mpsoc_vcu_h264`` for H.264.

The table below describes all the options for the Xilinx video decoder.

   ====================================  ===========================
   Options                               Descriptions
   ====================================  ===========================
   .. option:: -low_latency              | **Enable low-latency mode**
                                         | Valid values: 0 (default) and 1
                                         | Setting this flag to 1 reduces decoding latency when :option:`splitbuff-mode` is also enabled. Streams containing B frames are not supported in low-latency mode. 
   .. option:: -splitbuff_mode           | **Configure decoder in split/unsplit input buffer mode**
                                         | Valid values: 0 (default) and 1
                                         | The split buffer mode hands-off buffers to next pipeline stage earlier. Enabling both :option:`splitbuff-mode` and :option:`low-latency` reduces decoding latency.
   .. option:: -entropy_buffers_count    | **Number of internal entropy buffers**
                                         | Valid values: 2 (default) to 10
                                         | Can be used to improve the performance for input streams with a high bitrate (including 4k streams) or a high number of reference frames. 2 is enough for most cases. 5 is the practical limit.
