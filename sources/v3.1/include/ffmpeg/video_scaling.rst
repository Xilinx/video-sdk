Video Scaling
*************

The Xilinx hardware scaler is leveraged in FFmpeg by using the :option:`multiscale_xma` complex filter and the `FFmpeg filter graph syntax <https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Filtergraph-syntax-1>`_. This section describes the options of the :option:`multiscale_xma` complex filter.

For optimal visual quality in scaling operations, refer to :ref:`ABR Scaling <tuning-abr-scaling>` section of the |SDK| user guide.


.. option:: multiscale_xma

  Filter implementing the Xilinx ABR multiscaler. Takes one input and up to 8 output streams. The complete list of options is described below.


.. list-table:: Multiscale Filter Options
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Options
     - Description
   * - .. option:: outputs    
     - | **Specify the number of scaler outputs** 
       | Valid values are integers between 1 and 8     
   * - .. option:: out_{N}_width
     - | **Specify the width of each of the scaler outputs**
       | The output number {N} must be an integer value between 1 and 8, and must not exceed the number of outputs specified with :option:`outputs`
       | Valid values are integers between 3840 and 128, in multiples of 4  
   * - .. option:: out_{N}_height
     - | **Specify the height of each of the scaler outputs**    
       | The output number {N} must be an integer value between 1 and 8, and must not exceed the number of outputs specified with :option:`outputs`
       | Valid values are integers between 2160 and 128, in multiples of 4  
   * - .. option:: out_{N}_rate
     - | **Specify the frame rate of each of the scaler outputs**
       | By default, the scaler uses the input stream frame rate for all outputs. While the encoder supports frame dropping with the -r option, there is also hardware support in the scaler for dropping frames. Dropping frames in the scaler is preferred since it saves scaler bandwidth, allowing the scaler and encoder to operate more efficiently.
       | The output number {N} must be an integer value between 1 and 8, and must not exceed the number of outputs specified with :option:`outputs`
       | Valid values: ``full`` and ``half`` (default ``full``). The first output has to be at full rate (``out_1_rate=full``).
   * - .. option:: enable_pipeline
     - | **Enable pipelining in multiscaler**
       | Pipelining provides additional performance at the cost of additional latency (2 frames). By default, pipelining is automatically controlled based on where the scaler input is coming from. If the input is coming from the host, pipelining is enabled. If the input is coming from the decoder then pipelining is disabled. Explicitly enabling pipelining has benefits in two situations: in a 2-device use cases where the output of the scaler is transfered to the host; in zero copy 4K ABR ladder use cases with multiple renditions.
       | Valid values: -1 to 1 (default -1)
       | auto (-1)
       | disabled (0)
       | enabled (1)

Using the Multiscale Filter
===========================

The filter graph specification for the :option:`multiscale_xma` filter should be constructed in the following way:

- Add the :option:`multiscale_xma` filter to the graph   
- Set the number of scaler outputs
- Set the width, height, and rate settings for each scaler output 
- Define the name each scaler output
- If the outputs are not to encoded on the device, add :option:`xvbm_convert` filters to the filter graph to copy the frames back to the host and convert them to AV frames.

The following example shows a complete command to decode, scale and encode to five different resolutions::

    ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i input.mp4 \
      -filter_complex " \
        multiscale_xma=outputs=4: \
        out_1_width=1280: out_1_height=720: out_1_rate=full: \
        out_2_width=848:  out_2_height=480: out_2_rate=half: \
        out_3_width=640:  out_3_height=360: out_3_rate=half: \
        out_4_width=288:  out_4_height=160: out_4_rate=half  \
        [a][b][c][d]; [a]split[aa][ab]; [ab]fps=30[abb]" \
      -map "[aa]"  -b:v 4M    -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y ./scaled_720p60.mp4 \
      -map "[abb]" -b:v 3M    -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y ./scaled_720p30.mp4 \
      -map "[b]"   -b:v 2500K -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y ./scaled_480p30.mp4 \
      -map "[c]"   -b:v 1250K -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y ./scaled_360p30.mp4 \
      -map "[d]"   -b:v 625K  -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y ./scaled_288p30.mp4

This example can also be found in the FFmpeg introductory tutorials: :ref:`Transcode With Multiple-Resolution Outputs <transcode-with-abr-ladder>`.


Multiscale Usage Considerations
===============================

Managing Input Resolutions
--------------------------
The decoder supports resolutions which are multiples of 2, but the multiscaler supports resolutions which are multiples of 4. Therefore, pipelines leveraging both the decoder and the multiscaler will only work for streams with resolutions which are multiples of 4. 

If the resolution out of the decoder is not a multiple of 4, the decoded output can be copied back to the host using the :option:`xvbm_convert` filter and can be scaled to a suitable resolution using a software filter. 


Performance Considerations
--------------------------
Encoded input streams with a high bitrate or with a high number of reference frames can degrade the performance of an ABR ladder. The :option:`-entropy_buffers_count` decoder option can be used to help with this. A value of 2 is enough for most cases, 5 is the practical limit.


Encoding Scaler Outputs
-----------------------

The outputs of an ABR ladder can be encoded on the device using either the ``mpsoc_vcu_h264`` or the ``mpsoc_vcu_hevc`` codec. All outputs must be encoded using the same codec.


Using Raw Scaler Outputs
------------------------

To return raw video outputs from the ABR ladder, use the :option:`xvbm_convert` filter to copy the frames from the device to the host and convert them to AV frames. The converted AV frames can then be used in FFmpeg software filters or directly saved to file as shown in this command::

  ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i input.mp4 \
  -filter_complex " \
    multiscale_xma=outputs=4: \
    out_1_width=1280: out_1_height=720:  out_1_rate=full: \
    out_2_width=848:  out_2_height=480:  out_2_rate=half: \
    out_3_width=640:  out_3_height=360:  out_3_rate=half: \
    out_4_width=288:  out_4_height=160:  out_4_rate=half  \
    [a][b][c][d]; [a]split[aa][ab]; [ab]fps=30[abb]; \
    [aa]xvbm_convert[aa1];[abb]xvbm_convert[abb1];[b]xvbm_convert[b1];[c]xvbm_convert[c1]; \
    [d]xvbm_convert[d1]" \
  -map "[aa1]"  -pix_fmt yuv420p -f rawvideo ./scaled_720p60.yuv \
  -map "[abb1]" -pix_fmt yuv420p -f rawvideo ./scaled_720p30.yuv \
  -map "[b1]"   -pix_fmt yuv420p -f rawvideo ./scaled_480p30.yuv \
  -map "[c1]"   -pix_fmt yuv420p -f rawvideo ./scaled_360p30.yuv \
  -map "[d1]"   -pix_fmt yuv420p -f rawvideo ./scaled_288p30.yuv

This example can also be found in the FFmpeg introductory tutorials: :ref:`Decode Only Into Multiple-Resolution Outputs <decode-and-scale-only>`.


Scaling and Encoding on Two Different Devices
---------------------------------------------

The |SDK| supports up to 32 scaled outputs streams per device, up to a maximum total equivalent bandwidth of 4kp60. For some use cases, such as 4K ladders or 1080p ladders many outputs, it may not be possible to scale or encode all streams on a single device. In this situation, it is possible to split the job across two devices and run part of job on one device and the other part on another device. This accomplished by using the :option:`-lxlnx_hwdev` option which allows specifying the device on which a specific job component (decoder, scaler, encoder) should be run.  

Consult the :ref:`Using Explicit Device IDs <using-explicit-device-ids>` section for more details on how to use the :option:`-lxlnx_hwdev` option and work with multiple devices.
