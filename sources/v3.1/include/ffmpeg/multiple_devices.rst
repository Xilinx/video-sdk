**********************************
Working with Multiple Devices
**********************************

By default (if no device identifier is specified) a job is submitted to device 0. When running large jobs or multiple jobs in parallel, device 0 is bound to run out of resources rapidly and additional jobs will error out due to insufficient resources. 

By using the :option:`-lxlnx_hwdev` and :option:`-xlnx_hwdev` options, the different components (decoder, scaler, encoder) of a job can be individually submitted to a specific device. This makes it easy and straightforward to leverage the entire video acceleration capacity of your system, regardless of the number of cards and devices. 

Consult the :ref:`Using Explicit Device IDs <using-explicit-device-ids>` section for more details on how to work with multiple devices.
