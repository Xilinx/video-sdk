To check the current loading of all the devices in your system, use the following command::

    xrmadm /opt/xilinx/xrm/test/list_cmd.json

This will generate a report in JSON format containing the load information for all the compute unit (CU) resources. The report contains a section for each device in the system. The device sections contain sub-sections for each of the CUs (decoder, scaler, lookahead, encoder) in that device. For example, the load information for the encoder on device 0 may look as follows:: 

    "device_0": {
        ...
        "cu_4": {
            "cuId         ": "4",
            "cuType       ": "IP Kernel",
            "kernelName   ": "encoder",
            "kernelAlias  ": "ENCODER_MPSOC",
            "instanceName ": "encoder_1",
            "cuName       ": "encoder:encoder_1",
            "kernelPlugin ": "/opt/xilinx/xma_plugins/libvcu-xma-enc-plg.so",
            "maxCapacity  ": "497664000",
            "numChanInuse ": "20",
            "usedLoad     ": "831472 of 1000000",
            "reservedLoad ": "0 of 1000000",
            "resrvUsedLoad": "0 of 1000000"
        },


The ``usedLoad`` value indicates how much of that resource is currently being used. The value will range from 0 (nothing running) to 1000000 (fully loaded). The ``reservedLoad`` value indicates how much of that resource is being reserved using XRM. The ``resrvUsedLoad`` value indicates how much of the reserved load is actually being used.

In the above example, the encoder is 83.14% utilized. An additional job may only be run on this device if it requires less than 17% of the encoder resources.
