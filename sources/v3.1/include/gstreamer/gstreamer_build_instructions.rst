Rebuilding GStreamer
**********************************************************

Source code and build scripts for the GStreamer plugins developed by Xilinx can be found the in the :file:`sources/video-sdk-gstreamer` folder of the |SDK| repository.

Follow these steps to rebuild GStreamer with the |SDK| plugins enabled:

#. Navigate the top of the |SDK| repository::

    cd /path/to/video-sdk

#. Make sure the sources have been downloaded from the repository::
    
    git submodule update --init --recursive

#. Navigate to the directory containing the GStreamer sources::

    cd sources/video-sdk-gstreamer

#. Download, build, patch and install the GStreamer packages::
  
   ./install_gst.sh

#. Clean the Xilinx GStreamer plugin libraries::

    ./clean_vvas.sh

#. Build and install the Xilinx GStreamer plugins::
  
    ./build_install_vvas.sh PCIe 1


**NOTE**: The script :file:`sources/video-sdk-gstreamer/install_gst.sh` script deletes the source files after the installation. In order to preserve the patched open source GStreamer sources, use the :file:`sources/video-sdk-gstreamer/retrieve_gst_sources.sh` script. This script clones the open source GStreamer sources and applies the Xilinx specific patches on top of it. The patched sources are available in the following folders:

- /tmp/gst-libav-1.16.2
- /tmp/gst-plugins-bad-1.16.2
- /tmp/gst-plugins-base-1.16.2
- /tmp/gst-plugins-good-1.16.2
- /tmp/gstreamer-1.16.2
