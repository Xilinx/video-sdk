XMA Scaler App
****************************************************

Scaler Test Instructions
====================================================

The scaler XMA application supports most of the scaler options supported by FFmpeg. The XMA application supports only YUV 4:2:0 input and outputs YUV 4:2:0 scaled elementary stream.

Scaler Usage
----------------------------------------------------

Before running scaler application, source the xcdr environment::

  source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

Running the scaler app with the ``--help`` option will print the complete list of options::

  u30_xma_scale --help

Below is the list of all the options of the scaler app:

.. literalinclude:: ./include/scaler_help.rst


Sample Scaler Command
----------------------------------------------------

Scale 1080p nv12 to 720p, 480p, 360p, and 240p nv12::

  u30_xma_scale -w 1920 -h 1080 -i ~/Kimono1_1920x1080_24.yuvNV12 -w 1280 -h \
        720 -o Kimono_1280x720.NV12 -w 852 -h 480 -o Kimono_852x480.NV12 -w \
        640 -h 360 -o Kimono_640x360.NV12 -w 480 -h 240 -o Kimono_480x240.NV12

Limitations of the Scaler App
====================================================

* There may be a performance degradation relative to ffmpeg with a high number of outputs/processes.
