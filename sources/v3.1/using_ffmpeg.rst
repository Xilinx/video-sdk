Introduction
************

FFmpeg is an industry standard, open source, widely used utility for handling video. FFmpeg has many capabilities, including encoding and decoding all video compression formats, encoding and decoding audio, encapsulating, and extracting audio, and video from transport streams, and many more. The |SDK| includes an enhanced version of FFmpeg that can communicate with the hardware accelerated transcode pipeline in Xilinx devices.

The FFmpeg executable included with version |version| of the Video SDK is a fork of the main FFmpeg GitHub (release 4.4, tag n4.4, commid ID dc91b913b6260e85e1304c74ff7bb3c22a8c9fb1) with a Xilinx patch applied to enable the |SDK| plugins.

It is not within the scope of this document to provide an exhaustive guide on the usage of FFmpeg. Various resources can be found online, for example:

-  https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html
-  http://howto-pages.org/ffmpeg/

The following sections describe the options used with FFmpeg to configure the various hardware accelerators available on Xilinx devices.

Example Commands
=====================================================

A simple FFmpeg command for accelerated encoding with the |SDK| will look similar to this one::

   ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i infile.mp4 -c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc -s:v 1920x1080 -b:v 1000K -r 60 -f mp4 -y transcoded.mp4

There are many other ways in which FFmpeg can be used to leverage the video transcoding features of Xilinx devices. Examples illustrating how to run FFmpeg for encoding, decoding, and transcoding with and without ABR scaling. To see examples of all these possibilities, refer to the :doc:`FFmpeg tutorials </examples/ffmpeg/tutorials>` included in this repository.
