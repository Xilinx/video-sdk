******************************
What's New
******************************

This version provides various performance and stability improvements, including:

- Support for |VT1| instances as well as Amazon EKS and ECS
- Support for Amazon Linux 2
- Improved density, especially when processing many low-resolution streams
- Improved runtime for both single and multi-process execution models
- Improved resiliency of XMA and XVBM libraries

|

*****************************************
Supported Platforms and Operating Systems
*****************************************

The |SDK| currently supports the following platforms:

- Xilinx Alveo U30
- |VT1|

The |SDK| currently supports the following software tools:

- FFmpeg 4.1

The |SDK| has been tested and validated by Xilinx on the following operating environments:

- Ubuntu 20.04 (Kernel 5.4)
- Ubuntu 18.04 (Kernel 5.4)
- RHEL 7.8 (Kernel 4.9.184)
- Amazon Linux 2

The above list of validated operating environments is not intended to be exclusionary. If you choose to run the |SDK| using a different operating environment and encounter issues, please `file a GitHub issue <https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk/issues>`_.

******************************
Limitations
******************************

- The scaler is tuned for downscaling and expects non-increasing resolutions in an ABR ladder. Increasing resolutions between outputs will reduce video quality. For more details see :ref:`Using FFmpeg for Video Scaling <using-ffmpeg-for-video-scaling>`.

- The |SDK| is optimized for live video real-time transcoding. For example, even though a single Alveo U30 card has the capability of running two Ultra HD (4K) transcodes in real-time at 60 frames per second (2x4kp60), running a single 4k stream at 120 fps is not supported. Similarly, a single Alveo U30 card supports up to 8x1080p60 transcodes in real-time, but it does not support fewer streams running at 120fps or beyond.

- When processing 4x 1080p60 streams, the scaler can only sustain a rate of 60fps for up to 5 outputs. Therefore, given 4 1080p60 input streams, real-time performance is only possible for up to 20 scaled outputs.

- The maximum bit-rate tested is 35 Mb/s; if the bit-rate is higher, the encoder might not work properly.

- ABR video transcode use cases have been tested with up to 5 output renditions per input for a maximum supported number of channels of 8 running real-time per card. 

- The lookahead feature is not supported when encoding streams to a 4k resolution.

******************************
Known Issues
******************************

Potential "failed" error code when sourcing the setup.sh script
=================================================================

- Description: If you source the setup script on a machine where the |SDK| environment has already been initialized, you will see the "failed" status being reported. 

- Solution: This is not an indication of a problem. This status simply states that your environment is already set up and that the system is ready for use.::
    
    -----Load xrm plugins-----
    {
        "response": {
            "name": "loadXrmPlugins",
            "requestId": "1",
            "status": "failed",
            "data": {
                "failed": "plugin xrmU30DecPlugin (version 2) is already loaded"
            }
        }
    }
    
    ---------------------------------------


Potential "Too many packets buffered for output stream 0:1" error when running FFmpeg
=====================================================================================
.. https://jira.xilinx.com/browse/CR-1110063

- Description: Some FFmpeg jobs may fail with a error message indicating "Too many packets buffered for output stream 0:1.". This is a known FFmpeg issue (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/6375) which is not specific to the |SDK|.

- Solution: Run FFmpeg with the ``-max_muxing_queue_size 9999`` option


Multiple "Starting new cluster" messages when encoding to Matroska
==================================================================
.. https://jira.xilinx.com/browse/CR-1092967

- Description: When encoding to .mkv, FFmpeg may have issues synchronizing video and audio data leading to messages of the following form: ``[matroska @ 0x563b3f675100] Starting new cluster``

- Solution: Pass ``-max_interleave_delta 0`` on the FFmpeg command line


Streams with rotation metadata may cause a segfault while transcoding
=====================================================================
.. https://jira.xilinx.com/browse/CR-1093015
.. https://jira.xilinx.com/browse/CR-1092997

- Description: The hardware transcode pipeline can be unstable on a stream with rotation metadata

- Solution: Use the FFmpeg ``-noautorotate`` option in cases where rotation metadata is present. 
  

Generating a device status report with the xrmadm tool does not work on |VT1| instances
=======================================================================================
.. https://jira.xilinx.com/browse/CR-1107503

- Description: The ``xrmadm /opt/xilinx/xrm/test/list_cmd.json`` command fails with a Traceback error message.

- Solution: None.


Reverting to the golden image may not work by default on some on-prem systems
=============================================================================
- Description: The ``xbmgmt program --revert-to-golden`` and ``xbmgmt flash --factory_reset`` command expects the golden image of the card to be flashed at a particular memory location. If this is not the case, the command will not work. 

- Solution: Relocate the golden image by following the instructions below.  

  .. _flashing-the-golden-image:

  #. To reflash the golden image, your system must be already configured with release 0.96.0 or newer. If this is not the case, `contact Xilinx <https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk/issues>`_.

  #. Set up your environment:: 

      source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh

  #. List the Management BDF of your devices::

      sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt examine

  #. For each device, run the following command to flash the golden image to the expected memory location::

      sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbflash.qspi --qspips-flash --input /opt/xilinx/firmware/u30/gen3x4/base/data/BOOT_golden.BIN --offset 0x6000000 --bar-offset 0x10000 --card <BDF>

  #. Once the golden image has been properly relocated, you can revert the card to the golden image by following the :ref:`card recovery instructions <card-recovery>`.
