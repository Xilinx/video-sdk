Moving Data through the Video Pipeline
**************************************

Automatic Data Movement
=======================

The |SDK| takes care of moving data efficiently through the FFmpeg pipeline in these situations:

Individual operations:

- Decoder input: encoded video is automatically sent from the host to the device
- Scaler input: raw video is automatically sent from the host to the device
- Encoder input: raw video is automatically sent from the host to the device
- Encoder output: encoded video is automatically sent from the device to the host

Multistage pipelines

- Pipelines with hardware accelerators only (such as transcoding with ABR ladder): the video frames remain on the device and are passed from one accelerator to the next, thereby avoiding unnecessary data movement between the host and the device
- Pipelines with software filters: when using the ouput of the decoder or the scaler with a FFmpeg software filter, the video frames are automatically copied back to the host, as long as the software filter performs frame cloning. Examples of such filters include ``fps`` and ``split``.


Explicit Data Movement
======================

It is necessary to explicitly copy video frames from the device to the host in these situations:

- Writing the output of the decoder or the scaler to file.
- Using the output of the decoder or the scaler with a software filter which does not perform frame cloning. 


This is done using the :option:`xvbm_convert` filter.

.. option:: xvbm_convert

  FFmpeg filter which converts and copies a XVBM frame on the device to an AV frame on the host


Examples using the :option:`xvbm_convert` filter can be found here:

- FFmpeg tutorials :ref:`Decode Only <decode-only>` and :ref:`Decode Only Into Multiple-Resolution Outputs <decode-and-scale-only>`
- FFmpeg examples with :doc:`Software Filters </examples/ffmpeg/filters>`
