The following table summarizes the number of Alveo U30 cards and Xilinx devices for each of the different instance sizes of the |VT1| family.
For more details about the transcoding performance of these different configurations, refer to the :ref:`performance tables <perf-tables>` in the :doc:`Specs and Features </specs_and_features>` page of this documentation.

#. Launch an |VT1| Instance

   - Follow the instructions at `Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance>`_

   - When choosing the instance type in the EC2 console, make sure to select the |VT1| instance family. 

   - When choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), make sure to select the Xilinx Video SDK AMI for VT1 Instances for `Ubuntu 18.04 <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uovkpvr5ebzci>`_ or for `Amazon Linux 2 <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cwdoams4wrymi>`_

   - To get more information about |VT1| instances sizes and pricing see the `VT1 web page <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/vt1/>`_

#. Connect to the |VT1| Instance

   - After launching the instance, follow the instructions in `Connect to your instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux>`_ to connect to the instance. 

#. Clone the |SDK| repository::

    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk

   - Cloning the repo downloads the source for the examples and tutorials.
   - It is not needed to install the binary packages included in the repository as they already installed in the public |SDK| AMI. 

#. Set up the runtime environment::

    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

   .. note::
      The script may issue a "Failed to start xrmd.service" message which can safely be ignored.

   - This step should be performed each time you open a new terminal on your instance. 
   - You are now ready to use the video acceleration features of your |VT1| instance. 

#. Run your first examples

   - See the :ref:`tutorials and examples <tutorials-and-examples>` page to learn how to run video transcoding jobs on your |VT1| instance.

****************************************************
Installing the |SDK| on an existing AMI
****************************************************

In order to use a custom AMI on a |VT1| instance, it is necessary to install the |SDK| in the AMI. This section explains how to do this. These steps are not necessary when using the public |SDK| AMI since it already includes a complete installation of the |SDK| and can readily be used on a |VT1| instance.

Additionally, AWS provides packer scripts to make it easy for customers to build their own AMI’s for use with VT1 instances. Those scripts can be found at the following repo: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-vt-baseami-pipeline

Prerequisites
====================================================
Install the following packages if they are not already present in your AMI.

- For Ubuntu::

    sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)
    sudo apt install python

- For AL2::

    sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
    sudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r) boost-devel gcc-c++ -y



Installation Procedure
====================================================

#. Open a bash shell in your existing AMI

#. Download the packages included in this repository::

    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/video-sdk

#. Navigate to the directory containing the packages corresponding to your Operating System::

    cd ./video-sdk/release/<os>

#. Install the software components of the |SDK|::

    ./install.sh -sw

   A successfull installation will end with the following messages::

    Successfully wrote (76557 bytes) to the output file: /opt/xilinx/xcdr/xclbins/transcode.xclbin
    Leaving xclbinutil.

#. Always set up the runtime environment for the |SDK| before running video transcoding jobs on your |VT1| instance::

    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

   .. note::
      The script may issue a "Failed to start xrmd.service" message which can safely be ignored.
